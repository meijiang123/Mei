## Welcome to GitHub Pages

  My personal experience has influenced me to major in music education. I immigrated to America when I was in fifth grade; the unfamiliar condition, language, and ethnic differences once impeded my integration into school. I was scared to interact with other students because of my ethnic differences. Nevertheless, my middle school band teacher empowered me to overcome my low self-esteem. He motivated me to participate in the school band and ensemble which created more opportunities for me to interact with other students. As a result, I was able to consort with many classmates and realize that it is okay to be different. This influenced me to want to foster an inclusive environment for students as I become a music teacher. I want to be able to help those students who are undertaking the same painful experience that I have gone through and guide them to surmount their setbacks and pessimistic feelings. 
  From there, my musical journey begins. The first band concert that I attended in middle school confirmed my passion for music and my primary instrument. The delicate soprano sound of flute echoed through the band, kindling every musical cell within my body. I realized at that moment that the flute will be my primary instrument for the rest of my life. After diligent practice, I auditioned for high school regional and all-state bands and acquired the opportunity to perform with those ensembles. I enjoy the feelings where everybody works together to achieve one goal; it is a very precious experience. This is also one of the reasons that motivated my participation in the band, this will be my eleventh year of being in the band. I was the principal flute player in my high school band and received the Director’s Award in my senior year. I was a member of the Tri-M honor society. I am the Head of Public Relations of the National Association for Music Education at Central Connecticut State University.    
  I believe that the musical talent that made me stand out among other flutists is my ability to produce a beautiful tone color on the flute. My private teacher always complimented my capacity of being able to produce a beautiful hollow sound on the flute. In order to pass on this skill, I will teach my flute student the fundamentals of long tones. It will help them develop muscle and control their embouchure. 
  One of my favorite books about multicultural pedagogy is Geneva Gay’s Culturally Responsive Teaching. In this book, Gay utilizes the form of storytelling to illustrate culturally responsive teaching. As a Chinese American immigrant, I develop a strong empathy for this book. Many scenarios of color students who struggled in school in this book were similar to my own experience. I was able to learn many scaffolding strategies and ponder on how to utilize my own experience to create a culturally inclusive environment for my future students. I will incorporate multicultural activities in my lesson, for example, songs or games from other countries. I will work together with their parents to learn more about their countries’ culture and create a scaffolding strategy that best facilitates students’ learning processes.
